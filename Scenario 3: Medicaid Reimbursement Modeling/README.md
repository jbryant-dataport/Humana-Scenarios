## 🔍 Background Overview  
State Medicaid programs regularly reevaluate provider reimbursement to ensure financial sustainability. This project models the impact of service-specific rate adjustments and compares current vs modeled paid amounts.

The goal: Help stakeholders explore the *fiscal impact of rate changes* across service categories like Emergency Room, Primary Care, and Behavioral Health.

## 💡 Insights
- **Behavioral Health** and **Primary Care** experienced the **largest increases** in modeled spend.
- **Emergency Room** spending was reduced, simulating a policy scenario to reduce high-cost acute care.
- **Dental** services remained flat, modeling no rate change.

---

## ✅ Recommendations  
- Use this model to simulate **future fiscal scenarios** before proposing rate changes.  
- Layer in **utilization data** to model population growth and expected service volume.  
- Leverage this view to advocate for **balanced rate policy**, especially in high-growth or high-cost areas.

---

## ⚠️ Caveats and Assumptions  
- The rate change scenarios are **illustrative only** and not based on actual policy.  
- Utilization trends are **not included** in this version.  
- This model uses **mock data** for demonstration and portfolio purposes only.
